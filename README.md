# LoRa RFFI algorithm

This repository implements the code proposed by [1].
The implementation is not complete and only covers the device classification, as this is part of a learning process.

The results shown in the Jupyter Notebook are the outcome of a training using only 100 frames from 10 devices, hence the scruffiness and lack of precision. We did not proceed with a larger training due to a lack of hardware and time.
